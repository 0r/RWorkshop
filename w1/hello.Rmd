Rmarkdown is a language for incorporating text and R code into documents so that analyses may be easily understood, archived, and made reproducible.  This document provides a simple example of a workflow:

First, we upload data.  I keep data on the internet so it may be accessed and shared anywhere at my discretion.  

```{r}
dat=read.csv('hello.csv')
```

Look at raw data:
```{r}
dat
```


How about some summaries?

```{r}
tapply(dat$score,dat$condition,summary)
```

They might be different.  How about a plot:
```{r}
boxplot(score~condition,data=dat)
```

How about a t-test
```{r}
t.test(score~condition,data=dat,var.equal=T)
```
